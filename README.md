# JobPortal – Full Stack Job Management Application

## 📌 Project Overview
JobPortal is a full-stack web application developed using **Spring Boot** for the backend and **React** for the frontend.  
The application allows users to manage job postings by performing **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations through REST APIs and a responsive user interface.

This project follows an **industry-standard monorepo structure**, where both frontend and backend are maintained in a single repository.
